TO DO:
-Add Face Pose (Done)
-Plot EAR vs Rx,Ry,Rz (Done)
-Figure out Thresholds function

- Side Face detector -- so that if it is on for a second or more it generates a warning (because driver not looking at the road)
-Incorporate Gaze
-Better Face detector (ML model so that recognizes a face at weird angles)
